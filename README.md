# ðŸŽ² AskToJaum

Inspired by [pergunteaopolvo.com](https://pergunteaopolvo.com), this project is a simple question system that accepts **more than two alternatives** and returns a randomly chosen answer.

---

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: for the main logic
- **Math**: for handling randomization (`Math.random()`)

---

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use
1. Insert the desired options into a **text block**, making sure that **each option is written on a new line**.  
   Example:
Pizza
Burger
Sushi
Salad

3. The system will randomly pick one of the provided options using the `Math` library.

Possible output:
Sushi!
